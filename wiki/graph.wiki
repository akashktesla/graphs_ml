*Tasks:*
    1. *node classification*: predict a property of a node
    2. *link prediction*: predict whether there are missing links between two nodes
    3. *graph classification*: categorize different graphs 
    4. *clustering*: detect if nodes form a community
    5. *graph generation*
    6. *graph evolution*

Edge level ML:
   * link prediction 

Node-level feature 
structure based features:
    * node degree: counts the number of neighboring nodes
    * clustering coefficient: measure how connect3ed neighboring nodes are  
    * graphlet degree vector: counts the occurences of different graphlets
